To process the equithermal regulation of the mentioned house, 
I had to download data from the nearest meteorological station from https://opendata.chmi.cz/meteorology/climate/
These values are ground temperatures from 10-minute measurements from 2018-2024 (CSV) and 2025 (JSON).
Special thanks Mr. Petr Cihlář and Mgr. Lucie Kašičková.
